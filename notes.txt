New machine setup:

Make sure that the NVidia SDK manager finishes its post-flash SDK install, or the libraries needed to build will be missing.
If it doesn't already exist, unpack Tegra_Multimedia_API_R32.2.3_aarch64.tbz2 (or a newer version, from NV developer downloads) to /usr/src, creating /usr/src/tegra_multimedia_api


Don't forget to set up the submodules after cloning:

git submodule init
git submodule update

Install prerequisite packages:

sudo apt-get install scons libhidapi-dev libhidapi-hidraw0 libboost-all-dev libudev-dev clang lldb

Additional prereqs for the RDMA framework and rdma-client
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev librdmacm-dev

udev permissions:

# udev rules for Vive (contents of /etc/udev/rules.d/83-hmd.rules )
# update and run `sudo udevadm control --reload`

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0bb4", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0bb4", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"

Make sure that the user you're running as is members of the "plugdev" and "input" groups.
plugdev is required to open the Vive's /dev/hidraw* node
input is required to open nodes under /dev/input for the USB-HID remote control

To avoid accidentally powering off the Jetson with the USB-HID remote, disable systemd's response to power/suspend/hibernate/whatever keys:
edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf :

[Login]
HandlePowerKey=ignore
HandleSuspendKey=ignore
HandleHibernateKey=ignore
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore

then sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind #(NOTE: this will kill your login session!)

Disabling the desktop environment:
sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target            # takes effect immediately
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target        # to persist across reboots

Reenabling the desktop environment
sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target             # takes effect immediately
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target         # to persist across reboots



Camera ISP settings are stored at /var/nvidia/nvcam/settings/camera_overrides.isp
The vendor ISP settings may be adjusted to improve flicker correction. These settings have been found to work well for capturing at 90fps and correcting for 60hz flicker:
flicker.ConfidenceThreshold = 32;
flicker.SuccessFrameCount = 8;
flicker.FailureFrameCount = 3;
flicker.CorrectionFreqListEntries = 4;
flicker.CorrectionFreqList = {60, 90, 100, 120};

The default Sharpening filter should be disabled to improve accuracy of Charuco target detection:
sharpness.v5.enable = FALSE;



====== Nvidia Visual Profiler (nvvp) (on desktop) =====
CUDA 11.1 + Ubuntu 20.04 nvvp will fail to launch out-of-the-box with a Java error.
solution: nvvp needs to run under the java 8 runtime (and as root, typically)

  sudo apt install openjdk8-jre
  sudo update-alternatives --config java
  select OpenJDK 8

nvvp can then be run with sudo /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvvp
